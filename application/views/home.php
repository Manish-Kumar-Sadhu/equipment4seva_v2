                <p>UC (<a href="<?php echo $yousee_website->value; ?>" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yousee</a>) has worked on creating a pool of medical and non medical equipment, as a volunteer force providing free services. We call this pool an Equipment Bank or Equipment4Seva.</p>
                <p> We encourage more philanthropic organisations to use this service and approach to manage equipment so that:</p>
                <ul class="points">
                    <li>We reduce the expenditure on buying new equipment, by sharing and using the equipment optimally.</li>
                    <li>Making the equipment available where and when needed, adopting principles of Just-in-time and low inventory.</li>
                    <li>The equipment whom we call as silent volunteers, are handled and used with care, enabling them to serve for a long period.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>UC aims to provide this facility for enabling free service Healthcare Institutions. If you would like to use this service to pool your equipment for seva or to request for an available equipment please contact us at at +91-9000183123 or +91-4049171149</p>
